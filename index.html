        <h3>Study</h3>

        <p>
          Hello, my name's Victor Brandão De Andrade and I'm 21 years old. I'm a computer
          science student at <em>"Universidade Federal de Campina Grande"</em> (UFCG). I got
          in the university in 2018, at that time I knew nothing about computer science or
          programming, actually I intended to get in the Civil Engineering course, but some
          friends convinced me to get in the computer science course, because based on what
          they knew about me, they thought that I'd like to course it. Turned out that I really
          liked the course.

        <h3>Work</h3>

        <p>
          My first job after I got in the course started in 2020, when I got into a project
          in a laboratory at the university and I've been working there for almost 2 years.
          The name of the lab is <em>"Software Practices Laboratory"</em> (SPLab) and 
          the name of the project is <em>"Electronic Police"</em> (ePol) which is in 
          partnership with the <em>"Polícia Federal"</em> (PF).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working there for almost 2 years now, and I've learned a lot of new 
          things since I've started at this job. I work with Machine Learning and 
          Artificial Intelligence using Python. My goal in the project is create a prototype
          using Machine Learning and AI to calculate similarity between police documents.

        <h3>Leisure</h3>

        <p>
          When I'm not working, I like to watch as many TV shows as I can. I have a lot of
          streaming services to watch my series and movies. I could make a list of all the
          shows and movies that I like, but it would be long...
          
          I also like to spend time listening to music, especially watching live concerts on 
          YouTube and wondering how amazing would be there watching live, and maybe meeting 
          the singers that I like...
        </p>

        <p>
          I like soccer and I cheer for <em>"São Paulo FC"</em>, but the team is terrible these
          days... So I get angry when I watch the games. I hope the team fix its manage problems
          as soon as it can, then the team maybe come back on track and starts winning again.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to go out with my friends on the weekends, to spend time together and have fun.
          One of my favorite places to go is the cinema, because as I said: "I like to watch as
          many TV shows as I can", but I also go to bars with my friends even though I don't drink
          alcohol.

      <h3>Skills</h3>

      <p>
        Since I started programming, my favourite programming language is Python. I've been working with
        this language since I got in my job at SPLab, but I also like to learn new skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've learnt programming using the procedural and the oriented-object paradigms, but the functional
        paradigm caught my attention, so I decided that I'd like to learn Clojure, which is a functional
        programming language, but by now I've studied just the basic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been working with back-end since I started at SPLab, but I'd like to learn front-end skills,
        so I could be a full-stack developer. That's why I'm building this portfolio web page, to exercise
        my new skills with HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
